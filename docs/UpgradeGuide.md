# PUI 16.0 Release

## Goals

The goals of the 16.0 release are:

- Introduce new `ProgressBar` component
- Rewrite `Modal` and `Flyout` components to be more accessible and configurable
- `Checkbox` now has an indeterminate state

## Big Changes

### ProgressBar

Previously progress bars was solely a CSS implementation. See the [ProgressBars](/progress_bars) page for details on new React component.

* ProgressBar css moved from `pivotal-ui/css/progress-bars` to `pivotal-ui/css/progress-bar`

### Modal

We rewrote the `Modal` component (formerly `BaseModal`) from the ground-up to be more usable and accessible.

#### Improvements

* Keyboard navigation is now preserved within the modal when it's open to prevent users from being able to tab onto and interact with background elements while the modal is open.

* Uses efficient CSS transitions instead of JavaScript-based animations to animate the modal opening/closing. This means the animation will be much smoother across all browsers (and especially in IE/Edge).

* Now possible to specify the duration of the open/close animation via the `animationDuration` prop (and still possible to disable animation entirely, if desired, if `animationDuration` is `0`).

* Easier to specify the width of the modal via the improved `size` prop.

* More reliably prevents scrolling of background elements while the modal is open.

#### Breaking Changes

* Modal component moved from `pivotal-ui/react/modals` to `pivotal-ui/react/modal`
* Modal css moved from `pivotal-ui/css/modals` to `pivotal-ui/css/modal`
* Renamed `BaseModal` component to `Modal`.
* The `ModalBody` and `ModalFooter` components have been removed. Now, to specify a modal body, just use the `children` prop on the `Modal`. To specify a modal footer, use the `footer` prop.
* Some minor prop changes:
  - The `size` prop, when given a value of `small`/`sm`, now gives the modal a width of `300px`, as originally intended. This value used to be the same as the default width (`744px`).
  - The old `animation` prop, which allowed disabling animation and which defaulted to `true`, has been removed. Now, use `animationDuration={0}` to disable animation.
  - The old `keyboard` prop, which allowed disabling pressing escape to close the modal, has been removed. Pressing escape now always closes the modal.
  - The old `acquireFocus` prop, which allowed disabling moving focus inside the modal when it opens, has been removed. Focus is now always moved inside the modal when it opens, and cycles between elements of the modal until the modal is closed.
  - The old `onEntered` and `onExited` props, which allowed providing callbacks that are called when the modal starts opening and finishes closing, have been removed.
* New CSS class names for each part of the modal:
  - `pui-modal-dialog-backdrop` is the background element that takes up the full screen when the modal is open
  - `pui-modal-dialog` is the wrapper element for the visible part of the modal (the box that appears in the center of the window)
  - `pui-modal-header` is the element within the dialog that wraps the title
  - `pui-modal-title` is the `h3` tag within the header that contains the title
  - `pui-modal-close-btn` is the close button within the dialog
  - `pui-modal-body` is the class name that wraps the `children` given to the modal
  - `pui-modal-footer` is the class name that wraps the `footer` given to the modal

### Flyout

We rewrote the `Flyout` component from the ground-up to be more usable and accessible.

#### Improvements

* Keyboard navigation is now preserved within the flyout when it's open to prevent users from being able to tab onto and interact with background elements while the flyout is open.

* Uses efficient CSS transitions instead of JavaScript-based animations to animate the flyout opening/closing. This means the animation will be much smoother across all browsers (and especially in IE/Edge).

* Now possible to specify the duration of the open/close animation via the `animationDuration` prop (and now possible to disable animation entirely with `animationDuration={0}`).

* More reliably prevents scrolling of background elements while the flyout is open.

* Now possible to change the icon in the flyout header via the `iconSrc` prop (which defaults to `"close"`, to render a close button by default).

#### Breaking Changes

* Some minor prop changes:
  - The old `open` prop is now called `show`, to be more consistent with the `Modal`.
  - The old `close` prop is now called `onHide`, to be more consistent with the `Modal`.
* New CSS class names for each part of the modal:
  - `pui-flyout-dialog-backdrop` is the background element that takes up the full container width/height when the flyout is open
  - `pui-flyout-dialog` is the wrapper element for the visible part of the flyout (the box that appears on the right side of the window)
  - `pui-flyout-header` is the element within the dialog that wraps the header and icon button
  - `pui-flyout-icon-btn` is the icon button within the flyout header
  - `pui-flyout-body` is the class name that wraps the `children` given to the flyout

### Table

* New table plugin: `withRenderTdChildren`. This allows you to more efficiently control the rendering of table cell contents via a `renderTdChildren` prop on table columns. The older `withCellRenderer` plugin is still available, but is no longer recommended when passing an inline function. The documentation has been updated to reflect this change. This plugin is also included by default on `AdvancedTable`.

### Checkbox

* New `indeterminate` enables putting the `Checkbox` in an indeterminate state (neither checked nor unchecked).

### Misc

* All animations/transitions in PUI now default to 200ms (0.2s). Previously, most things used 200ms, but some used 150ms or 300ms.
* Removed deprecated and unused `tab-highlight` and `tabs-images` CSS classes.

# PUI 15.0 Release

## Goals

The goals of the 15.0 release are:

- Rewrite & redesign Pagination component
- Rewrite Dropdown component to be less opinionated on its contents
- Make Autocomplete component easier to use
- Make font rendering crisper

## The Big Changes

### Pagination
We rewrote the Pagination component from the ground up, but its API has remained, mostly, the same.

Details:
- New design (rewritten CSS)
- Show up to 5 pages, always including the first and last, with ellipses in between if necessary.
- `onSelect` callback gets called with an object containing `newActivePage`,
the page number of the newly selected page (either the number that was clicked, `activePage + 1` if next button was clicked,
or `activePage - 1` if previous button was clicked).
- Removed `large` and `small` props.

### Dropdown
The changes to the Dropdown make it less opinionated about its children. Previously, it was necessary to have all children
of a Dropdown be DropdownItems, and the Dropdown would handle `onClick`-like events on these items. Now, any child node
can be passed as a child, and if a child needs an `onClick`, it should be set on that child directly.

Details:
- Removed DropdownItem component entirely
- Removed props: `href`, `labelAriaLabel`, `onSelect`, `onSplitClick`, `splitClassName`
- Added prop: `itemClassName` which provides a class to the `li` element that wraps each child of the dropdown

### Autocomplete
The changes to Autocomplete are meant to make it easier to control when and how the data in the list gets updated
from the outside.

Details:
- Add a new public method `updateList`, which updates the list of search results without showing the list. To see how this
this might be used, see the [Autocomplete](/autocomplete) page.
- Change the callback that is passed in to `onInitializeItems` to return a Promise, so that it can be awaited from
the outside if desired. This means that an outer component can wait for the inner trie data structure to be built
before calling `updateList` to update the list.

### Font Rendering
We removed CSS in PUI that was disabling subpixel antialising (see [here](http://usabilitypost.com/2011/02/08/please-stop-disabling-subpixel-rendering/) for more information).
The effect of this is that fonts appear crisper, brighter, and more vibrant.

# PUI 14.0 Release

## Goals

The goals of the 14.0 release are:

- Remove dependency on Bootstrap from all PUI components
- Remove all Bootstrap files from PUI

## The Big Changes

### Code component

All CSS from Bootstrap that styled `code`, `kbd`, `pre`, and `samp` elements has been moved to `pivotal-ui/css/code`. If these tags are no longer styled as expected, add `import 'pivotal-ui/css/code'` alongside your other CSS.

### Grids component

This component was based on Bootstrap Grids, and has been removed. Use our Flex Grids component and/or CSS classes instead. Here are some examples of the changes required to migrate from the older, Bootstrap-based component:

#### React

Deprecated Bootstrap-based Grid:

```
<Row>
  <Col md={8}>...</Col>
  <Col md={16}>...</Col>
</Row>
```

FlexGrid:

```
<Grid>
  <FlexCol>...</FlexCol>
  <FlexCol grow={2}>...</FlexCol>
</Grid>
```

#### CSS-only

Deprecated Bootstrap-based Grid:

```
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">...</div>
  <div class="col-md-16">...</div>
</div>
```

FlexGrid:

```
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col">...</div>
  <div class="col col-grow-2">...</div>
</div>
```

### Other Bootstrap CSS/utility classes

Any Bootstrap CSS that was not a part of any PUI component, but which was included by PUI, will no longer work. Install Bootstrap CSS separately if needed.

### Removed

The following components were deprecated several releases ago, and are no longer documented. They have now been removed:
- Bootstrap Grids component (`pivotal-ui/react/grids` and `pivotal-ui/css/grids`)
- Google Maps component (`pivotal-ui/css/google-maps`)
- Avatars component (`pivotal-ui/css/avatars`)

# PUI 13.0 Release

## Goals

The goals of the 13.0 release are:

- New interface and design of Panels
- Redesign of Dropdown and CheckboxDropdown

## The Big Changes

### Panels

- Panels have been redesigned to have a title, header, body, and footer section. You can insert components in the title and header sections. See the [Panels](/panels#examples) examples.
  - The panel title appears outside the rounded box
  - The panel header appears within the rounded box, separated from the content by a border
  - The panel body appears within the rounded box, below the header (if any)
  - The panel footer appears at the bottom of the rounded box.
- The panel body now has rounded corners and a box shadow by default.
- Previously, the panel `header` prop took a `Node`. Now, it takes a `string`, which it will place in the top left corner of the panel. This is intended to make panel headers more consistent by default. To get the old behavior back, do not pass a `header`, and use `headerCols={[<FlexCol key="some-key">{someNode}</FlexCol>]}`.
- Panel CSS classes are now prefixed with `pui-`.
- The classes `panel`, `panel-body`, `panel-header` and `panel-footer` have been removed. You can either:
   - update your CSS by prepending `pui-` OR
   - you can pass those classes in via the  `bodyClassName`, `headerClassName`, or `footerClassName` props.

```
<Panel {...{
  className: 'panel',
  bodyClassName: 'panel-body',
  headerClassName: 'panel-header',
  footerClassName: 'panel-footer'
}}></Panel>
```

### Dropdown/CheckboxDropdown

- Icon no longer positioned absolutely

# PUI 12.0 Release

## Goals

The goals of the 12.0 release are:

- Fix Form alignment issues
- Namespace the CSS of new components with `pui-`
- Redesign the Checkbox and Radio component
- Fix the `Icon` component to be `create-react-app` compatible
- Enhance the Table component to determine column headers from the data

## The Big Changes

### Table
- When no `columns` prop is given, the table will automatically determine the columns and column headers based on the keys of `data`.
- See the [Tables](/tables#examples) example

### Checkbox
- CSS selectors prefixed with `pui-`, eg. `pui-checkbox`
- Update the styling
- Remove props related to forms: `displayError`, `errorMessage` and `label`.

### Radio
- CSS selectors prefixed with `pui-`, eg. `pui-radio`
- Update the styling

## Conversion Guide

### Checkbox
- Use the new [Form](forms) component to obtain functionality such as field labels, tooltips, and help text.

# PUI 11.0 Release

## Goals

The goals of the 11.0 release are:

- Introduce new Form component

## The Big Changes

### Removed
- Label component 
- `.form-group` class has been removed.

### Input, Toggle

```jsx
<Form className="example-form">
  <FormRow className="mbxl">
    <FormCol {...{
      name: 'orgName',
      label: 'Label Layer',
      help: 'Error or Help text Layer'
    }}>
      <Input {...{placeholder: 'I am in the content layer'}}/>
    </FormCol>
    <FormCol {...{
      name: 'other',
      retainLabelHeight: true
    }}>
      <Input {...{placeholder: 'No label or help text, but still lines up!'}}/>
    </FormCol>
  </FormRow>
  <FormRow>
    <FormCol {...{
      name: 'other',
      label: 'Inline Label',
      inline: true
    }}>
      <Input {...{placeholder: 'The field and the label lines up when inline'}}/>
    </FormCol>
  </FormRow>
</Form>

```
#### Form Unit

- it's a layered cake
  - top is for labels (green)
  - middle is for content (blue)
  - the bottom is for messages/help text/ error text (red)
- the goal is to make it easy to build rhythmic 8pt grid conforming forms

## Conversion Guide

### Input, Toggle
- Use the new Form component to obtain functionality such as field labels, tooltips, and help text.

### Select
- The `onChange` callback will now receive the new `value` as a second argument, instead of putting it on `event.target.value`.

# PUI 7.0 Release

## Goals

The goals for the 7.0 release are:

- Update and consolidate Buttons and Dropdowns
- Replace Font Awesome Icons with SVGs
- Make it easier for people to use SVGs

## The Big Changes

- Buttons and Dropdowns are visually redesigned
- Button and Dropdown React Components are all new, see the conversion guide below
- Iconography React component now uses SVGs instead of Font Awesome
- Deprecated Gravatars, Checked Lists, and non-React Back To Top Component
- Deprecate current spinners component. New spinners are waiting to be prioritized.

Full list: [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Conversion Guide

### Buttons

The buttons all have updated styles, and there are fewer of them.

- `DefaultAltButton` is removed. Use `DefaultButton` instead. You may want to set the `alt` prop to true. If you still want the shadows, use [box shadows](/box_shadows)
- `LowlightButton` is removed. It can be approximated with `DefaultButton` with `flat` set to true
- `HighlightButton` is renamed to `PrimaryButton`
- `HighlightAltButton` is removed, just use `PrimaryButton`. Marketing sites may want to use `BrandButton`. Web apps are discouraged from using `BrandButton`.


### Dropdowns

There are no longer 7 dropdown components (`LinkDropdown`, `DefaultDropdown`, `HighlightDropdown`, etc). There is only `Dropdown`.
The `Dropdown` component takes many React props. To recreate the old `LinkDropdown`, you can use `Dropdown` with `flat` and `link` props set to true.
Most of the other old dropdown styles have been removed. There are basically only three launcher styles now: default, flat, and split.

### React Iconography

- Use the `src` prop instead of the `name` prop
- The `Icon` component will inline SVGs instead of using Font Awesome. Many of the icons may have different names and different layout properties.
- Webpack svg-react-loader is now required for iconography. If you are using pui-react-tools, you will need to `npm install` the webpack loaders and upgrade pui-react-tools to version ^2.0.0.
- Icons no longer take the `size` prop. Instead, they are sized at the local font size.
If you want an icon with a different size, you can change the font size around that icon. For example, if you set the font size to 24px, the SVG should be 24px wide and 24px tall.
You can also provide a `style` prop with `width` and `height` if that is more appropriate.

### CSS Iconography

If you are using iconography, but not using React, it will be more difficult to use. All of the SVGs are inside of the `pui-css-iconography` node module.
If you would like to use an icon, you can use the SVGs directly from the node module.
If you do not mind black icons, you can serve up the SVGs and use them inside of `img` tags.
If you need to color your icons, you need to copy the content of the SVG and put it directly into your html. CSS can then be used for colors.

### CSS Alerts

Alerts look the same, but the css has changed from float to flexbox. If you have a multi-line alert, you may need to add an extra div directly inside of your alert wrapping your old contents.
Also, the close button is no longer float: right, so it needs to be at the end of your alert html.

### General

There are more breaking changes than usual in this release, it is possible we missed something. Please file issues on github or ask questions on the pivotal-ui slack channel.


# PUI 6.0 Release

## Goals

The goals for the 6.0 release are:

- Remove React Bootstrap Dependency
  - This should make it much easier for teams to choose their version of React without causing dependency conflicts.
  - This will also make it easier in the future to use non-Bootstrap designs.
- Add a couple new React Components

## The Big Changes

- Alert: The `dismissable` prop is now just a boolean. If you want a function that is called on dismissal, use the `onDimiss` prop.
- Modals: The `bsSize` prop has been renamed to `size`.
- React Bootstrap: Alerts, Grids, Modals and Tabs are now entirely different code paths. The goal was to replace all old functionality, but undocumented behavior may have changed.

Full list: [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## New Components

- `CopyToClipboard`
- `CopyToClipboardButton`
- `Svg`


# PUI 5.0 Release

- The 5.0 release is a bump from React 14 to React 15.
- If you have no warning messages in React 14, the React 15 upgrade should be simple.
- All of the newest features in Pivotal UI are in the 4.0 release.


# PUI 4.0 Release

## Goals

The goals for the 4.0 release are:

- Add and improve React components as needed by teams
- Consolidate similar React components
- Consolidate some styles
- Improved CSS building

## The Big Changes

- The `typography` React component has been removed in favor of native headers
- Header font weights default to normal
- base text color has been darkened to improve contrast
- `OverlayTrigger` now supports manual mode and does not use React Bootstrap
- `OverlayTrigger` `trigger` prop is now a string and not an array
- `Tooltip` is all new in order to work with new `OverlayTrigger`
- Some components have been renamed, see [conversion guide](#05_conversion)
- CSS scales, traffic lights, and fancy select have been removed
- React components are all ES6 classes for easier subclassing
- pui CSS node modules can be directly imported with Webpack loaders

Full list: [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pivotal-ui/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## New Components

- `Checkbox`
- `Pagination`
- `Toggle`

## Conversion Guide

### Typography

pui-react-typography is no longer supported.
Replace `<DefaultH2>`, `<AlternateH2>` or `<MarketingH2>` with `<h2>`.
The headers will now be less bold. This is intended by the designers.
If your application wants headers to be bigger and bolder, add CSS in your own application.

### Renames

- `<BasicInput>` becomes `<Input>`
- `<SearchInput>` becomes `<Input search>`
- `<SimpleTabs>` becomes `<Tabs>`
- `<SimpleTabsAlt>` becomes `<Tabs tabType="simple-alt">`
- `<SortableTable>` becomes `<Table>`
- `<OverlayTrigger trigger={['hover']}>` becomes `<OverlayTrigger trigger="hover">`
- Use `TileLayoutItem` instead of `TileLayout.Item`
- Look for `RadioGroup` in `pui-react-radio`

### Other changes

- Stop using the `fancy-select` CSS class, just use regular selects.
If you want a fancy chooser, consider dropdowns.
- Provide a class to Input with the `inputClassName` prop instead of `className`.
- DropdownItem no longer automatically wraps content in an `a` tag unless an `href` prop is provided.
- The markup generated by tooltips is different. The classes are prefixed with 'pui-', like 'pui-overlay'.

### CSS Compiling

We would like to deprecate Dr Frankenstyle due to its performance issues and maintenance cost.
In PUI 4.0, you can use Webpack loaders instead.
The combination of `css-loader`, `file-loader` and `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
