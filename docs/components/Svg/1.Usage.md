The `Svg` component makes it easier to transform SVG files into React components so they can be rendered just like any other component. It uses Webpack's [`react-svg-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg-loader) and [`babel-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader) to do this transformation, so you must have these installed to use this component.

By default, `Svg` looks for SVG files located in the `app/svgs` folder at the root of your project
(defined here as the location of your `package.json`). For example, the following will render the file `app/svgs/my-logo.svg`:

```jsx harmony
//nonInteractive
<Svg src="my-logo" width="20" height="20" />
```

## Changing SVG file location

If you have SVG files in other folders, you can extend the `Svg` component and override the `svgPathLoader` method, as follows:

```jsx harmony
//nonInteractive
class MySvg extends Svg {
  svgPathLoader(src) {
    return require(`!!babel-loader!react-svg-loader!./path/to/svgs/${src}.svg`);
  }
}
```

The path is relative to the file where you extend the `Svg` component.

## Disabling optimizations
   
   Note that `react-svg-loader` will internally optimize your SVGs using [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo).
   This optimization will sometimes change your SVG in undesirable ways. You can turn off parts of the optimization with loader params. For example, the `Svg` component itself uses:
   
   ```jsx harmony
   //nonInteractive
    require(`!!babel-loader!react-svg-loader?{"svgo":{"plugins":[{"removeUnknownsAndDefaults":false},{"cleanupNumericValues":false},{"removeUselessStrokeAndFill":false}]}}!../../../../app/svgs/${src}.svg`);
   ```
